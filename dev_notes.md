# ðŸ§ª Dev Notes â€” Ruby Chess CLI

## Structure Plan

- `Board`: 2D grid with access methods
- `BoardRenderer`: Handles rendering to terminal
- `Piece`: Base class (color, position)
- Subclasses: `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, etc.

## Next Tasks

- [ ] Define basic `Piece` class with `color`, `symbol`, and placeholder `#moves`
- [ ] Implement `Pawn` and `Knight` with move stubs
- [ ] Integrate pieces into `Board`'s grid
